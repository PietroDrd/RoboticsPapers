# Instructions for Contribuitors
in the main [README](README.md) we will just list and link interesting (Mid-High level) of easy understanding papers, 
   
the linked paper **MUST HAVE**: `CODE` or `VIDEOS` or `WEBSITE`or `GitHub Repo` ... 
you can find the style i used to instert any paper directly in the README.md file

## TBD   
for each one it will be good to have a short/quick description

To do it fast and effortless i suggest to use [ChatGPT 4o](www.chatgpt.com) but be aware of errors and mistakes.

### Prompt: 
```
plese resume it with details in 60 words: PAPER.Link
```

to start we can just write everything in the [README](README.md).
Later on including multiple `.md` , one for each topic, is recommended!

### Suggestions - Help
Feel free to open an issue here on github or DM me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pietro-dardano/) for any suggestion, feedback, else...

Thanks.
